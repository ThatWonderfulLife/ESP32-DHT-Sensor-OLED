# ESP32-DHT-Sensor-OLED
A Simple display of temperature and humidity using a DHT22 Sensor and a Esp32 Dev Module.

Made using the Arduino IDE in C, the project gets the current temperature and Humidity of the room/ambience it is installed and displays it on a OLED Display.
In future iterations i'll try implementing a webserver to show the information on an HTTPS page and integrate MQTT to send the information daily to a computer/server for analysis and control over temperature under isolated enviroments.
